      Thanks to your work, we reported the issue to the admins and they've removed the blog. However, there's still vulnerabilities to be had, as we've received reports that the /login and /register routes are vulnerable to SQL injection! We don't have any user interface to login or register on, so we're stuck, but we know you'll be able to. Can you leak the admin's username?

      Note: Remember to use throwaway passwords when registering accounts on challenges.
