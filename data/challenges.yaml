  - challengeName: Blog 2
    description: |
      I'm in the process of revamping the blog to make it a little more interesting. There's no user interface right now, but I still want to test my `/login` and `/register` routes in case of SQL injection. Can you leak my username?

      It is recommended to have completed the JavaScript course before attempting this challenge. Try this code as a starting point:

      ```js
      fetch("/login", {
        headers: {
          "Content-Type": "application/json"
        },
        body: JSON.stringify({
          username: "User123",
          password: "Pass123"
        }),
        method: "POST"
      })
      ```
