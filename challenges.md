# javascript 3

*Challenge Name*: Script Kiddie
*Description*: Somebody broke into our network and locked us out, but thankfully, we managed to dig up some information about them - a bit too much information, perhaps. The attacker's data is somewhere in this dump and we know that their first name is the the same as their surname spelt backwards, ignoring capitalisation. Can you help us retrieve their account information?

# sql 3

*Challenge Name*: Blog 2
*Description*: Thanks to your work, we reported the issue to the admins and they've removed the blog. However, there's still vulnerabilities to be had, as we've received reports that the /login and /register routes are vulnerable to SQL injection! We don't have any user interface to login or register on, so we're stuck, but we know you'll be able to. Can you leak the admin's username?

Note: Remember to use throwaway passwords when registering accounts on challenges.
